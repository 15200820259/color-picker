# A Color Picker for Atom

Right click and select `Color Picker`, or hit `CMD-SHIFT-C`/`CTRL-ALT-C` to open it. Currently reads `HEX`, `HEXa`, `RGB`, `RGBa`, `HSL`, `HSLa`, `HSV`, `HSVa`, `VEC3` and `VEC4` colors â€“ and is able to convert between the formats.

It also inspects `Sass` and `LESS` color variables. Just open the `Color Picker` with the cursor at a variable and it'll look up the definition for you. From there, you can click the definition and go directly to where it's defined.
